### Data-Driven Strategy for High-Yield Vacation Rentals

## Executive Summary
This analysis evaluates the Manhattan vacation rental market using Airbnb data to guide investment decisions. The project identifies the most profitable property types and neighborhoods by analyzing booking frequency, property sizes, and revenue generation.

To measure market attractiveness, the analysis uses the number of reviews in the last 12 months as a proxy for booking frequency. After cleaning and standardizing the data (neighborhood labels, bedroom counts, and nightly revenue), I utilized advanced pivot tables to uncover demand patterns across the borough.

## Business Questions Addressed
* Market Demand: Which neighborhoods attract the most bookings?
* Product Optimization: Which property sizes (studios vs. multi-bedroom) are most popular?
* Revenue Potential: How much revenue do the top-tier listings generate in a 30-day window?

## Tech Stack and Methodology
* Tools: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, SUMIFS, Data Cleaning, Standardization)
* Data Points: Airbnb Listing Data and 30-Day Calendar Metrics
* Proxy Metrics: Used "Reviews in last 12 months" to determine the Attractiveness Score of a listing.

## Key Findings
* Top Neighborhoods: The most attractive areas for investment include the Lower East Side, Hell’s Kitchen, and Harlem.
* Optimal Property Size: 1-Bedroom units are the strongest performers across the top 10 neighborhoods.
* Midtown Exception: Studios are the exception in Midtown, where they outperform larger units.
* Revenue Benchmarks: The highest-earning listing generated $29,940 in 30 days, showing an annualized revenue potential exceeding $350,000.

## Project Deliverables
* Cleaned Dataset: Standardized neighborhood names and corrected bedroom count anomalies.
* Pivot Table Analysis: Detailed breakdown of demand by neighborhood and property type.
* Revenue Model: A calculation of nightly revenue aggregated to show monthly and annual projections.

## Investment Recommendations
Based on the data, investors should prioritize 1-bedroom apartments in the Lower East Side or Hell’s Kitchen to maximize occupancy. For investments specifically in the Midtown area, Studios provide the highest potential for booking frequency.
